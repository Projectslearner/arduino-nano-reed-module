# Reed Module with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a Reed switch module with an Arduino Nano to detect the presence of a magnetic field. The Reed switch is a magnetic sensor that changes its state when exposed to a magnetic field, causing it to close or open depending on the presence of the magnet.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Nano**
- **Reed Switch Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Reed Switch Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Nano.
   - **VCC:** Connect to 5V on Arduino Nano.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND on Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Reed switch module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output. It will display "Magnet detected" when a magnet is near the Reed switch, and "No magnet" when it's not.

#### Applications

- **Proximity Sensing:** Use for applications where detecting the presence or absence of a magnet is needed.
- **Door/Window Sensors:** Implement in security systems to detect open or closed states of doors or windows.
- **Automation:** Useful for integrating magnetic field sensing into automated systems.

#### Notes

- Ensure the Reed switch module is correctly connected to the Arduino Nano and powered.
- Use `INPUT_PULLUP` mode to activate the internal pull-up resistor, which helps stabilize the reading when the switch is open (no magnet).
- Adjust the delay in the code to control the rate of serial monitor updates.
